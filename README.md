### What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes constructing software by using pure functions, avoiding shared state and mutable data. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This approach promotes immutability, where data structures are not modified after they are created, and focuses on declarative code where the logic of computation is expressed without explicitly describing its control flow. Functional programming helps in writing more predictable, modular, and testable code by leveraging principles like higher-order functions, transparency referential, and lazy evaluation.
