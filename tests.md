# My Own Exercises

Take a look to the exercises that I solve in the **test folder**

### Basic Functional Programming

1. **Exercise 1: Basic usage of lambdas**
Description: Create a lambda expression that takes two integers and returns their sum.

2. **Exercise 2: Using Function**
Description: Define a function that takes a string and returns its length using the Function interface.

3. **Exercise 3: Using Predicate**
Description: Define a Predicate that takes an integer and returns true if it is even.

4. **Exercise 4: Using Consumer**
Description: Define a Consumer that takes a string and prints it in uppercase.

5. **Exercise 5: Using Supplier**
Description: Define a Supplier that returns a random string of 10 characters.

6. **Exercise 6: Filtering a list**
Description: Filter a list of integers to keep only the even numbers using streams and Predicate.

7. **Exercise 7: Mapping a list**
Description: Take a list of strings and use map to convert all strings to uppercase.

8. **Exercise 8: Reducing a list**
Description: Use reduce to sum all the elements of a list of integers.

9. **Exercise 9: Using flatMap**
Description: Take a list of lists of integers and use flatMap to convert it into a flat list of integers.

10. **Exercise 10: Sorting a list**
Description: Sort a list of strings in reverse alphabetical order using streams.

11. **Exercise 11: Using collect**
Description: Convert a list of strings into a single comma-separated string using Collectors.joining.

12. **Exercise 12: Creating an infinite Stream**
Description: Use Stream.iterate to create an infinite stream of even numbers and take the first 10 elements.

13. **Exercise 13: Using Optional**
Description: Use Optional to handle the possibility of null values when retrieving an element from a list.

14. **Exercise 14: Function composition**
Description: Combine two functions: one that multiplies a number by 2 and another that adds 3, and apply the composed function to a number.

15. **Exercise 15: Creating a Stream of objects**
Description: Create a Person class with name and age attributes. Then, create a stream of Person objects and filter those who are over 18 years old.

16. **Exercise 16: Grouping elements**
Description: Use Collectors.groupingBy to group a list of strings by their length.

17. **Exercise 17: Partitioning elements**
Description: Use Collectors.partitioningBy to divide a list of integers into even and odd numbers.

18. **Exercise 18: Counting elements**
Description: Use Collectors.counting to count the number of strings in a list.

19. **Exercise 19: Calculating statistics**
Description: Use Collectors.summarizingInt to obtain statistics (sum, average, max, min) from a list of integers.

20. **Exercise 20: Using parallelStream**
Description: Convert a list of integers into a parallelStream and find the sum of all elements.
